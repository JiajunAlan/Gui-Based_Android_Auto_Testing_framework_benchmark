By contrast, the GNU General Public&#10;License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free&#10;software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This&#10;General Public License applies to most of the Free Software&#10;Foundation&apos;s software and to any other program whose authors commit to&#10;using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by&#10;the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to&#10;your programs, too.&#10;&#10;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not&#10;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you&#10;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for&#10;this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it&#10;if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it&#10;in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.&#10;&#10;  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#10;anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.&#10;These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you&#10;distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.&#10;&#10;  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#10;gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that&#10;you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the&#10;source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their&#10;rights.&#10;&#10;  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and&#10;(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,&#10;distribute and/or modify the software.&#10;&#10;  Also, for each author&apos;s protection and ours, we want to make certain&#10;that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free&#10;software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we&#10;want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so&#10;that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original&#10;authors&apos; reputations.&#10;&#10;  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software&#10;patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free&#10;program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the&#10;program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any&#10;patent must be licensed for everyone&apos;s free use or not licensed at all.&#10;&#10;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#10;modification follow.&#10;&#10;GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#10;TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#10;&#10;  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains&#10;a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed&#10;under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,&#10;refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"&#10;means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:&#10;that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,&#10;either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another&#10;language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in&#10;the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".&#10;&#10;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not&#10;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of&#10;running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program&#10;is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the&#10;Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).&#10;Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.&#10;&#10;  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s&#10;source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you&#10;conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate&#10;copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the&#10;notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;&#10;and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License&#10;along with the Program.&#10;&#10;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and&#10;you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.&#10;&#10;  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion&#10;of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and&#10;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1&#10;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#10;&#10;    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices&#10;    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#10;&#10;    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in&#10;    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any&#10;    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third&#10;    parties under the terms of this License.&#10;&#10;    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively&#10;    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such&#10;    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an&#10;    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a&#10;    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide&#10;    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under&#10;    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this&#10;    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but&#10;    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on&#10;    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)&#10;&#10;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#10;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,&#10;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in&#10;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those&#10;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you&#10;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based&#10;on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of&#10;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the&#10;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.&#10;&#10;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest&#10;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to&#10;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or&#10;collective works based on the Program.&#10;&#10;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program&#10;with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of&#10;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under&#10;the scope of this License.&#10;&#10;  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,&#10;under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of&#10;Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:&#10;&#10;    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable&#10;    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections&#10;    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,&#10;&#10;    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three&#10;    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your&#10;    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete&#10;    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be&#10;    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium&#10;    customarily used for software interchange; or,&#10;&#10;    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer&#10;    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is&#10;    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you&#10;    received the program in object code or executable form with such&#10;    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)&#10;&#10;The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for&#10;making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source&#10;code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any&#10;associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to&#10;control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a&#10;special exception, the source code distributed need not include&#10;anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary&#10;form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the&#10;operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component&#10;itself accompanies the executable.&#10;&#10;If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering&#10;access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent&#10;access to copy the source code from the same place counts as&#10;distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not&#10;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#10;&#10;  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program&#10;except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt&#10;otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is&#10;void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.&#10;However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under&#10;this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such&#10;parties remain in full compliance.&#10;&#10;  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not&#10;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or&#10;distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are&#10;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by&#10;modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the&#10;Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and&#10;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#10;the Program or works based on it.&#10;&#10;  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the&#10;Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the&#10;original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to&#10;these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further&#10;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted herein.&#10;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to&#10;this License.&#10;&#10;  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent&#10;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#10;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#10;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#10;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#10;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#10;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you&#10;may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent&#10;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by&#10;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then&#10;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to&#10;refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.&#10;&#10;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under&#10;any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to&#10;apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other&#10;circumstances.&#10;&#10;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any&#10;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any&#10;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the&#10;integrity of the free software distribution system, which is&#10;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#10;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#10;through that system in reliance on consistent application of that&#10;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing&#10;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot&#10;impose that choice.&#10;&#10;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to&#10;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#10;&#10;  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in&#10;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the&#10;original copyright holder who places the Program under this License&#10;may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding&#10;those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among&#10;countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates&#10;the limitation as if written in the body of this License.&#10;&#10;  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions&#10;of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will&#10;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to&#10;address new problems or concerns.&#10;&#10;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program&#10;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any&#10;later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions&#10;either of that version or of any later version published by the Free&#10;Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of&#10;this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software&#10;Foundation.&#10;&#10;  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free&#10;programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author&#10;to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free&#10;Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes&#10;make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals&#10;of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and&#10;of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.&#10;&#10;NO WARRANTY&#10;&#10;  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY&#10;FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN&#10;OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES&#10;PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED&#10;OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF&#10;MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS&#10;TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE&#10;PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,&#10;REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#10;&#10;  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING&#10;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR&#10;REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,&#10;INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING&#10;OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED&#10;TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY&#10;YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER&#10;PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE&#10;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#10;&#10;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#10;&#10;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs&#10;&#10;  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest&#10;possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it&#10;free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.&#10;&#10;  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest&#10;to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively&#10;convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least&#10;the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&#10;&#10;&lt;one line to give the program&apos;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;&#10;Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#10;&#10;This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify&#10;it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by&#10;the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or&#10;(at your option) any later version.&#10;&#10;This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#10;but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#10;MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the&#10;GNU General Public License for more details.&#10;&#10;You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along&#10;with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,&#10;51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.&#10;&#10;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.&#10;&#10;If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this&#10;when it starts in an interactive mode:&#10;&#10;Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author&#10;Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w&apos;.&#10;This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it&#10;under certain conditions; type `show c&apos; for details.&#10;&#10;The hypothetical commands `show w&apos; and `show c&apos; should show the appropriate&#10;parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may&#10;be called something other than `show w&apos; and `show c&apos;; they could even be&#10;mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.&#10;&#10;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your&#10;school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if&#10;necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:&#10;&#10;Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program&#10;`Gnomovision&apos; (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.&#10;&#10;&lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989&#10;Ty Coon, President of Vice&#10;&#10;This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into&#10;proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may&#10;consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the&#10;library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General&#10;Public License instead of this License.&#10;&#9;&#9;' checkable="false" checked="false" clickable="true" enabled="true" focusable="false" focused="false" scrollable="false" long-clickable="false" password="false" selected="false" bounds="[21,985][1060,1794]" />

It also counts&#10; as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence&#10; the version number 2.1.]&#10;&#10;                            Preamble&#10;&#10;  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#10;freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public&#10;Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change&#10;free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.&#10;&#10;  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some&#10;specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the&#10;Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You&#10;can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether&#10;this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better&#10;strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.&#10;&#10;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,&#10;not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that&#10;you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge&#10;for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get&#10;it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of&#10;it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do&#10;these things.&#10;&#10;  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#10;distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these&#10;rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for&#10;you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.&#10;&#10;  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis&#10;or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave&#10;you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source&#10;code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide&#10;complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them&#10;with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling&#10;it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.&#10;&#10;  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the&#10;library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal&#10;permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.&#10;&#10;  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that&#10;there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is&#10;modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know&#10;that what they have is not the original version, so that the original&#10;author&apos;s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be&#10;introduced by others.&#10;.&#10;  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of&#10;any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot&#10;effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a&#10;restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that&#10;any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be&#10;consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.&#10;&#10;  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the&#10;ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser&#10;General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and&#10;is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use&#10;this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those&#10;libraries into non-free programs.&#10;&#10;  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using&#10;a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a&#10;combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary&#10;General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the&#10;entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General&#10;Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with&#10;the library.&#10;&#10;  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it&#10;does Less to protect the user&apos;s freedom than the ordinary General&#10;Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less&#10;of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages&#10;are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many&#10;libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain&#10;special circumstances.&#10;&#10;  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to&#10;encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes&#10;a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be&#10;allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free&#10;library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this&#10;case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free&#10;software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.&#10;&#10;  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free&#10;programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of&#10;free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in&#10;non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU&#10;operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating&#10;system.&#10;&#10;  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the&#10;users&apos; freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is&#10;linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run&#10;that program using a modified version of the Library.&#10;&#10;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#10;modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a&#10;"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The&#10;former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must&#10;be combined with the library in order to run.&#10;.&#10;                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#10;   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#10;&#10;  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other&#10;program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or&#10;other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of&#10;this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").&#10;Each licensee is addressed as "you".&#10;&#10;  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data&#10;prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs&#10;(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.&#10;&#10;  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work&#10;which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the&#10;Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under&#10;copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a&#10;portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated&#10;straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is&#10;included without limitation in the term "modification".)&#10;&#10;  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for&#10;making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means&#10;all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated&#10;interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation&#10;and installation of the library.&#10;&#10;  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not&#10;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of&#10;running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from&#10;such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based&#10;on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for&#10;writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does&#10;and what the program that uses the Library does.&#10;&#10;  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library&apos;s&#10;complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that&#10;you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an&#10;appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact&#10;all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any&#10;warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the&#10;Library.&#10;&#10;  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#10;and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a&#10;fee.&#10;.&#10;  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion&#10;of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and&#10;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1&#10;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#10;&#10;    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.&#10;&#10;    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices&#10;    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#10;&#10;    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no&#10;    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.&#10;&#10;    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a&#10;    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses&#10;    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility&#10;    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,&#10;    in the event an application does not supply such function or&#10;    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of&#10;    its purpose remains meaningful.&#10;&#10;    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has&#10;    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the&#10;    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any&#10;    application-supplied function or table used by this function must&#10;    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square&#10;    root function must still compute square roots.)&#10;&#10;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#10;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,&#10;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in&#10;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those&#10;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you&#10;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based&#10;on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of&#10;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the&#10;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote&#10;it.&#10;&#10;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest&#10;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to&#10;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or&#10;collective works based on the Library.&#10;&#10;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library&#10;with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of&#10;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under&#10;the scope of this License.&#10;&#10;  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public&#10;License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do&#10;this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so&#10;that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,&#10;instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the&#10;ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify&#10;that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in&#10;these notices.&#10;.&#10;  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for&#10;that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all&#10;subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.&#10;&#10;  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of&#10;the Library into a program that is not a library.&#10;&#10;  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or&#10;derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form&#10;under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany&#10;it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which&#10;must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a&#10;medium customarily used for software interchange.&#10;&#10;  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy&#10;from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the&#10;source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to&#10;distribute the source code, even though third parties are not&#10;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#10;&#10;  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the&#10;Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or&#10;linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a&#10;work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and&#10;therefore falls outside the scope of this License.&#10;&#10;  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library&#10;creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it&#10;contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the&#10;library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.&#10;Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.&#10;&#10;  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file&#10;that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a&#10;derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.&#10;Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be&#10;linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The&#10;threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.&#10;&#10;  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data&#10;structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline&#10;functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object&#10;file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative&#10;work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the&#10;Library will still fall under Section 6.)&#10;&#10;  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may&#10;distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.&#10;Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,&#10;whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.&#10;.&#10;  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or&#10;link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a&#10;work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work&#10;under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit&#10;modification of the work for the customer&apos;s own use and reverse&#10;engineering for debugging such modifications.&#10;&#10;  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the&#10;Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by&#10;this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work&#10;during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the&#10;copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference&#10;directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one&#10;of these things:&#10;&#10;    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding&#10;    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever&#10;    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under&#10;    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked&#10;    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that&#10;    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the&#10;    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified&#10;    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood&#10;    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the&#10;    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application&#10;    to use the modified definitions.)&#10;&#10;    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the&#10;    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a&#10;    copy of the library already present on the user&apos;s computer system,&#10;    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)&#10;    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if&#10;    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is&#10;    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.&#10;&#10;    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at&#10;    least three years, to give the same user the materials&#10;    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more&#10;    than the cost of performing this distribution.&#10;&#10;    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy&#10;    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above&#10;    specified materials from the same place.&#10;&#10;    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these&#10;    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.&#10;&#10;  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the&#10;Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for&#10;reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,&#10;the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is&#10;normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major&#10;components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on&#10;which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies&#10;the executable.&#10;&#10;  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license&#10;restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally&#10;accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot&#10;use both them and the Library together in an executable that you&#10;distribute.&#10;.&#10;  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the&#10;Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library&#10;facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined&#10;library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on&#10;the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise&#10;permitted, and provided that you do these two things:&#10;&#10;    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work&#10;    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library&#10;    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the&#10;    Sections above.&#10;&#10;    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact&#10;    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining&#10;    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&#10;&#10;  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute&#10;the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any&#10;attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or&#10;distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your&#10;rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,&#10;or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses&#10;terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.&#10;&#10;  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not&#10;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or&#10;distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are&#10;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by&#10;modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the&#10;Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and&#10;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#10;the Library or works based on it.&#10;&#10;  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the&#10;Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the&#10;original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library&#10;subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further&#10;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted herein.&#10;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with&#10;this License.&#10;.&#10;  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent&#10;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#10;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#10;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#10;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#10;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#10;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you&#10;may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent&#10;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by&#10;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then&#10;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to&#10;refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.&#10;&#10;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any&#10;particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,&#10;and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.&#10;&#10;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any&#10;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any&#10;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the&#10;integrity of the free software distribution system which is&#10;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#10;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#10;through that system in reliance on consistent application of that&#10;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing&#10;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot&#10;impose that choice.&#10;&#10;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to&#10;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#10;&#10;  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in&#10;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the&#10;original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add&#10;an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,&#10;so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus&#10;excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if&#10;written in the body of this License.&#10;&#10;  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#10;versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.&#10;Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,&#10;but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.&#10;&#10;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library&#10;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and&#10;"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and&#10;conditions either of that version or of any later version published by&#10;the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a&#10;license version number, you may choose any version ever published by&#10;the Free Software Foundation.&#10;.&#10;  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free&#10;programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,&#10;write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is&#10;copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free&#10;Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our&#10;decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status&#10;of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing&#10;and reuse of software generally.&#10;&#10;                            NO WARRANTY&#10;&#10;  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO&#10;WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.&#10;EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR&#10;OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY&#10;KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE&#10;IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#10;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE&#10;LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME&#10;THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#10;&#10;  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN&#10;WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY&#10;AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU&#10;FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR&#10;CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE&#10;LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING&#10;RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A&#10;FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF&#10;SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH&#10;DAMAGES.&#10;&#10;                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#10;.&#10;           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries&#10;&#10;  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest&#10;possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that&#10;everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting&#10;redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the&#10;ordinary General Public License).&#10;&#10;  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.
